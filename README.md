# Development Ideas

This repository is for the discussion of development ideas for the [FOOOF](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof) tool for parameterizing neural power spectra.

The goal of this repository is to separate out code & maintenance questions for the FOOOF package from discussion of ideas about new versions or substantial changes to the FOOOF approach. As a rule of thumb, if the idea or question is about the code in the project, it's likely a code or maintenance problem, whereas if it's idea is about the concepts and approach, it's likely a development idea, for our purposes. 

### Code or Maintenance Questions

Anything that relates to a bug report, an implementation question, requesting help for using the module, or a feature request that doesn't required a major update (for example, a new function in an existing module, or an extension of an existing functionality) is, for our purposes, considered a code or maintenance issue.

Code or maintenance questions should be directed to [issues page](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof/issues) of the [main repository](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof).

### Development Ideas

By development ideas, we mean ideas for a new idea or conceptual approach about how FOOOF should work, and/or anything that would require a major new release or the development of a new sub-module. 

For example:
- significant changes to the underlying algorithm and how it works
- additions of new sub-modules to the package
- operating on different kind of data or inputs

For any ideas that fall into this category, please open an [issue](https://github.com/fooof-tools/development/issues) in this repository. 

Once an issue is opened, this repository can then be used by FOOOF developers to discuss and explore these ideas. If an idea is decided upon, a plan will be made for implementation, which can move to a fork or branch of the core repository, once the idea is translated into code tasks.
